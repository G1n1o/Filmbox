# Filmbox

A comprehensive cinema application that allows users to browse the repertoire, reserve seats, and purchase tickets online. The project includes full payment integration (Stripe) and user authorization with Okta.

CinemaApp was built using **Angular** on the frontend and **Spring Boot** on the backend, providing a complete system for managing movie screenings, seats, reservations, and user accounts. The goal of the application is to offer a smooth, intuitive experience for browsing movies, selecting seats on an interactive map of the auditorium, and completing secure online payments.

The frontend uses **Bootstrap** to ensure a fully responsive layout and a clean, modern interface. The **Swiper** library is used to create a dynamic movie carousel, allowing users to quickly explore available titles.

The backend, developed in **Spring Boot**, handles business logic and communicates with a **MySQL** database. The system uses a relational schema with connected tables such as:  
**movies, screenings, seats, tickets, users, reservations** — accurately reflecting real cinema operations. Integration with **Spring Data JPA** made CRUD operations and database communication more efficient and maintainable.


## Technologies Used
